# Spelunky 2 Archipelago Mod
This mod allows you to connect to Archipelago in order to play a multiworld randomizer. Every journal entry is a location that you can check, and the item you send out could be anything from anyone's game, including your own. For more information about Archipelago, visit their [website](https://archipelago.gg/) or join their [Discord server](https://discord.gg/8Z65BR2).
## Features
- Multiple game options to customize your experience, such as:
    - The goal of the run
    - How worlds should be unlocked
    - Starting Health, Bombs, and Ropes
    - A variety of disruptive traps
    - Death link, where if someone dies in their game, you die as well. The reverse is also true
- Worlds must be unlocked
    - By default, you will have access to the Dwelling. To progress any further than that, you will need to find or be sent world unlocks from other people in the multiworld
- Chain items must be unlocked
    - In order to use chain items, you must first find or be sent that particular item from other people in the multiworld

# Installation Instructions
1. Download the latest version of the Spelunky 2 apworld from the github release page below
2. Double click the downloaded apworld to automatically install it to Archipelago, or manually move the file into the custom_worlds folder of your Archipelago installation
3. Download the latest version of Modlunky 2 [here](https://github.com/spelunky-fyi/modlunky2/releases/latest) and latest "Spelunky 2 Archipelago.zip" from the other release page below.
4. Open up Modlunky 2, and drag the "Spelunky 2 Archipelago.zip" onto it -- this will change it to the "Install Mods" tab and at the bottom right use the "Install selected file to existing pack"
5. Navigate to the Playlunky tab in Modlunky 2, toggle "Spelunky 2 Archipelago" and click "Play!"
    - It is HIGHLY recommended to turn on the "Use Playlunky Save" in the options menu! This mod frequently overwrites the save used by the game, and while it does make backups, errors can occur. I cannot be held liable if you lose your save file while using this mod.
6. Once on the main menu, you will need to enable the mod manually, as it requires unsafe mode to load the library used to connect to Archipelago
7. Enter your slot name, the server address, and password (if applicable) in the popup menu and click connect to connect to Archipelago
    - If you receive a message saying "Socket Error: invalid http status", restart your game. I don't know why this happens, but restarting the game usually fixes it
8. Once you see a message saying "Slot Connected" in the top left, you are connected to Archipelago and ready to begin playing!

For any suggestions or bug reports, please join the Archipelago Discord server (linked above), navigate to the future-game-designs forum, and find the Spelunky 2 thread. I likely won't see them anyplace else.
